# DATA-PROFESSIONAL-SURVEY-BREAKDOWN

Welcome to the "Data Professional Survey Breakdown" Power BI project! 
In this analysis, I have delve into insights derived from a comprehensive dataset obtained from the raw data available at https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx . 
The dataset was meticulously processed to ensure accuracy and relevance by eliminating duplicate values and removing unnecessary columns, leveraging the Power Query Editor.

This Power BI project aims to provide an interactive and visually appealing exploration of the data, offering a detailed breakdown of key trends and patterns within the realm of data professionals. 
Through the utilization of Power BI Desktop, I have crafted compelling visualizations that enable users to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
