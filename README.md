# Power-BI_Project-1
Welcome to the Power BI Data Visualization Project for the Data Professional Survey Breakdown! 
This project aims to provide insightful visualizations and analysis of survey data related to the data professional industry. 
For this project I have cleaned the raw data from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx using Power Query Editor and build up interactive visuals using Power BI Desktop.
